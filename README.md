# nov2217_calculator

1) Create a function called calculator that takes three parameters, `x`, `y`, `z` <br />
2) Create a variable called output; this is where your number returned from your function will be stored <br />
3) The first parameter determines the mathematical operation to be performed <br />
4) Parameters `y` and `z` are any two numbers <br /> 
5) Your function should have five conditionals that perform the four different mathematical operations depending on `x` (add, subtract, multiply, divide) <br />
6) Invoke your function, pass in your values, and console.log `output` <br />
7) Test your function using node.js <br />
